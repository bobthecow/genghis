## v2.0.0

Brand new features:

 * Genghis doesn't require a webserver! Ghengis.php now runs as a standalone server with the PHP 5.4 CLI SAPI.
 * Genghis doesn't require PHP! Introducing Genghis.rb — Thanks @TylerBrock for doing all the work :)
 * Add super-simple RubyGems installation. `gem install genghisapp` is the new hotness.
 * Add a command line executable / daemon. You're just a `genghisapp` away. How rad is that?
 * Add support for pre-configured servers via the `$GENGHIS_SERVERS` environment variable.
 * Add support for replica sets, e.g. `localhost:12345/?replicaSet=production`.

Tons of improvements:

 * Add this CHANGELOG. Meta.
 * Genghis now has a more refined visual style — greeeeen!
 * More responsive design (check it in a really small window!)
 * Epic document parsing and rendering overhaul:
    * Huge speed improvements. Rendering, collapsing and scrolling like wow.
    * Date, ObjectId and regular expression values (and more) are now formatted (and edited) for humans, not robots.
    * Documents are now displayed _and edited_ as Genghis Flavored JSON, a more lenient and intuitive superset of JSON.
 * UX Improvements:
    * Speed up the initial page load time.
    * Update code editor. The new one (CodeMirror) is lighter, faster, smaller and a cleaner implementation.
    * Add Cmd+Enter / Ctrl+Enter keyboard shortcut for saving the document being edited.
    * Prevent "new document" modal from closing on background click.
    * Better "keyboard shortcuts" dialog on smaller screens.
    * Require database name confirmation rather than DELETE before removing a db.
    * Collection removal is paranoid as well: it also requires confirmation before removing.
    * Restore spinning states to most sections — a spinner will show rather than displaying incorrect or outdated info.
    * Expando-matic search box. No more squinting or scrolling to see your massive queries.
 * Update Bootstrap (2.1.0), jQuery (1.8.0), Underscore (1.3.3), and Backbone (0.9.2).
 * Use UglifyJS instead of closure compiler to minify JS. It's faster and doesn't require Java :)
 * Mustaches! Now using Hogan.js instead of Underscore templating.
 * Check for updates. You can disable this with a `$GENGHIS_NO_UPDATE_CHECK` environment variable.
 * Add a welcome screen with project link and version info.
 * The README has way more to READ.
 * Spun off Bootstrappy styles for Apprise into their own project. [Check it out!](https://github.com/bobthecow/apprise-bootstrap)
 * All this while reducing the codebase by about 10%. BOOM.

And a handful of bug fixes:

 * [Fix #19][i19] — Only implicitly wrap MongoIds if they're 24 character hex strings.
 * [Fix #20][i20] — Support creating and editing documents with an `attributes` property.
 * Fix output glitches when displaying a brand new document immediately after an existing document.
 * Fix — possible JavaScript error when adding a new collection.
 * Fix — handful of rare (and relatively benign) error messages.
 * Fix — malformed server DSN could prevent servers list from rendering.
 * Fix — rare bug where properties with a specific structure might be mistaken for ObjectIds or Dates.
 * Fix — no longer recreates missing dbs and collections on GET requests.
 * Fix — all sorts of things now 404 if they're missing, rather than rendering an empty page.
 * Fix — assorted issues with running in subdirectories, and under nginx.
 * Improve error handling in a couple of places.
